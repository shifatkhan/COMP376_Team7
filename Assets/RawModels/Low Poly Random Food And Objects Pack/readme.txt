#Lowpoly Pixel Objects

This pack contains 71 models from scenes made for each day of december, following prompts from Low Poly Dailies.  Perhaps it's better to call them an artbook of sorts rather than an asset pack.

Polygon count is below 500 tris per model, texture size varies from 16x16px to 64x32px. Included modesl are listed in contents.txt.

For best results make sure the texture compression in your engine is set to lossless. Distortions become very noticeable on tiny textures, similar to pixelart sprites.
