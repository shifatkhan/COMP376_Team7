Since the prototype presentation, there has been a lot of addition. Approximately 95% of the game has been done
since then. This includes creating the restaurant environment, adding customers AI, setting up the main 
character and adding its animations, creating visual indications, having the camera follow the player, 
added sound FX in the game, creating a throwing mechanic, and adding 3 levels with 3 stages in each, 
which increases in difficulty.

For more information, see section 18 - Change Logs in the GDD.
